Wizard Tower Arena Roguelite – Design Document (2024 Draft)
Game Premise
The player ascends a legendary wizard’s tower, battling hordes of magical enemies in ever-shifting arenas. Each floor of the tower is unique, themed around different branches of arcane knowledge or failed experiments. Combat is entirely spell-based: no swords, no axes, no arrows—just pure spell-slinging chaos.

Core Gameplay Loop
Enter Arena:
Player steps into a themed battle arena (single room per floor).

Face Waves:
Survive waves of increasingly difficult enemies (aim: 8 waves per floor), with enemy composition, AI, and hazards growing more complex over time.

Boss Showdown:
Defeat a boss unique to the current floor theme. Bosses summon support enemies (“adds”) and use signature magical attacks.

Shop Interludes:
Between sets of waves and after boss fights, players visit a magical shop to purchase new spells, upgrades, healing, or utility items.

Ascend:
Portal appears—player moves to the next floor (new arena + new theme). Order of floors is randomized every run; arenas within themes are also randomized.

Victory or Defeat:
Climb continues until death or final victory.

Tower Floor Structure
Themes:
5–6 unique tower themes (example: Alchemy, Inferno, Library, Time, etc. — final themes TBD and flexible).

Arena Variations:
Each theme contains 2–3 distinct, hand-crafted arena layouts (roughly 10–18 rooms total).

Single-Room Focus:
Each level is one focused, highly-polished battle arena, dressed to fit the current theme. No multi-room dungeons or labyrinths.

Props & Hazards:
Arenas feature modular props and hazards (e.g. caustic pools, burning braziers, magic runes, shifting bookshelves) themed per floor. Some hazards may randomize activation/location per run.

Boss/Shop Rooms:
Unique layouts for boss battles and shops, styled per theme.

Combat and Player Abilities
No Melee:
The player only uses magic spells, each with upgrade paths. All attacks are ranged/area or employ “spell tech.”

Movement:
Fast, skill-based: sprint, dash, multi-jump. Fluid arena navigation is required to survive.

Upgradeable Spells:
Spells are modular, unlockable, and can be enhanced between waves in the shop. Some spells may be acquired during the run as random rewards.

Roguelite Progression:
Spell upgrades, shop items, and run modifiers are random each session (“choose 1 of 3” upgrade, random shop inventory, etc.). Core meta-progression outside runs is minimal or TBD.

Waves & Enemy Design
Each floor’s progression:

8 main waves increasing in difficulty (enemy number, tactics, synergies, occasional “elite” variants).
Final wave = unique boss fight (with themed adds and environmental hazards).
Enemy Variety:
Distinct enemy archetypes per theme and across themes. All are “magical in nature” (constructs, homunculi, elementals, rival mages, failed experiments, magical fauna…).

Status Effects:
Enemies and player both interact with advanced combat effects (freeze, burn, poison, slow, mana drain, etc.), clearly indicated visually and audibly.

Shops and Rewards
Between Waves:
Shops appear to break up the action, allowing players to spend acquired resources (gold, mana, arcane shards—final currency TBD) to purchase:

New spells/unlocks
Upgrades for current spells (“mods,” mutators, damage, cooldown)
Healing
Utility items (stat boosts, temporary buffs, escape tools, etc.)
Shopkeeper:
Themed/whimsical (e.g. wizard merchant, talking spellbook, magical vending machine). Appearance and UI styled to match current floor.

Replayability & Randomization
Floor Themes and Order:
Order of tower floors/themes is randomized each run.

Arenas Per Theme:
Each run picks from 2–3 arena variants per theme, also randomized.

Enemy Waves:
Each wave features random spawns and compositions pulled from a weighted pool.

Hazards/Props:
Certain obstacles/hazards may activate/shuffle between runs to keep rooms feeling fresh.

Boss Variants:
Possible boss variation or “elite” bosses for advanced runs or challenges.

Art, Audio, and UX
Visuals:
Strong theming per floor. Vibrant effects, clear readability for spells/status effects. Preference for readability over photorealism.

Audio:
Dynamic soundscape, responsive magical effects, theme-appropriate music for each floor, boss, and shop.

Controls:
PC-focused (mouse + keyboard), responsive first-person movement. UI is clean—HUD, spell bar, wave/boss/shop screens only.

Scope, Modularity, and Project Philosophy
Lean and Modular:
Design focuses on scope control. All arenas, shops, hazards, and enemies are modular/prefab-driven for easy future expansion or remixing.

Expand Later, Polish Now:
Release targets fun core gameplay, polishing a small number of highly distinct themes/levels. More content/complexity can come post-release.

Player Experience First:
Prioritize speed, clarity, and fun over raw content mass or feature bloat.

Extra Features/Future Candidates
Daily/Weekly Challenges
Meta-progression unlocks (cosmetics, new spells)
Special event floors or mutators
Secret rooms, hidden interactions, or rare elite enemies
